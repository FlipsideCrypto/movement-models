{% docs core__fact_blocks %}

This table contains "block" level data for the m1 blockchain. This table can be used to analyze trends at a block level, for example total transactions over time.
"The m1 blockchain doesn't have an explicit notion of a block â€” it only uses blocks for batching and executing transactions.
A transaction at height 0 is the first transaction (genesis transaction), and a transaction at height 100 is the 101st transaction in the transaction store."
